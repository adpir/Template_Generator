## Description:
On this project, my challenge was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a crucial piece in making code maintainable, I ensure that all unit tests pass.

### Installation:

The installation I used to make sure the development environment is running efficiently.The user need to ```install npm``` the know as **Node Package Manager**) from a user's input using the ```inquire package```. Create a ```.gitignore file``` and ```.DS_Store``` so that your ```node_modules``` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Remember to create a ```.gitignore file``` before installing any ```npm``` dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a ```package.json```. Create one by running ```npm init``` when you first set up the project. Use the Inquirer npm package to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. I make sure to install this program below:
