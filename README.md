<h1 align="center"> Template Generator</h1>


## Description:
On this project, my challenge was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a crucial piece in making code maintainable, I ensure that all unit tests pass.
